# Projects I've worked on

Here's a small list of projects ordered from most complete and proud of to
least complete and proud of while also being categorized.

## Web projects

- [meetballs.org](https://github.com/onelikeandidie/meetballs.org) - A website
    listing projects and sessions for the meetballs community. The projects can
    be the script from the host of the session or a project that was worked on
    the meetup.
- [Doky CMS PHP](https://github.com/onelikeandidie/doky-cms.php) - A
    laravel-based CMS that syncs with a git repository and serves the content 
    of the repository. When first loaded, it will clone the repository and then
    pull the changes. The content will be written to the database and is
    available to be edited on the frontend by logged in users. It supports user 
    authentication and role permissions. The database can be synced back to the
    git repository by a logged in admin. The main idea is to have a CMS that 
    can be used by developers and non-developers. A fork is used in production
    for [Auto Finesse Help Center](https://help.autofinesse.com), which at the
    time of writing has no public documentation and only has internal staff
    documentation.
- [This blog](https://github.com/onelikeandidie/piresgg) - This blog, you can
    learn a little about it in the [about page](/post/about).

## Tools

- [Typo-eq](https://github.com/onelikeandidie/typo-eq) - CLI application for
    training typing in other languages, designed to import xdxf dictionaries
    and use them for training. It supports profiles and has a simple interface.
    When finishing a session, it shows the statistics of the session.
- [Impulsive Player](https://github.com/onelikeandidie/impulsive-player) - A
    music player that plays music at seemingly random intervals simulating
    minecraft's music player. It can play .mp3, .flac, .ogg and .wav files.
- [Nebulang](https://github.com/onelikeandidie/nebulang) - Another scripting
    language, focused on input and vulkan graphics. The runtime is written in
    Rust and the language is transpiled into Nebulang Bytecode. I never
    completed the language, but I really liked the project and the syntax.

## Games

- [BattleShipGame](https://github.com/onelikeandidie/BattleShipGame) - My final
    project for university, a battleship game written in Java. It has a GUI and
    is fully software-rendered. It includes the project report that I wrote for
    university and is probably the best piece of documentation I've ever
    written. It uses no external libraries for game loop, rendering, or input
    handling which are all written from scratch and detailed in the report.
- [BuildingFood](https://github.com/onelikeandidie/BuildingFood) - A ddr-like
    game where you press the arrow keys to add ingredients to the food, it was
    made for a game jam and is a fun little game. It includes a combo system.
- [Border Gods](https://modrinth.com/mod/bordergods) - A minecraft mod that
    slowly increases the world border size over time. It was made for a private
    server as a refresher for the players. Interacting with the world in
    different ways will increase the world border size faster or slower
    depending on the action. There is different gods that your actions can
    appease or displease which determine the speed of the world border growth.
