# About me

My name is Pedro, I am a software engineer currently remotely working on the
backend for some webservices at Auto Finesse, a car detailing company based
in the UK.

I have a lot of issues with finishing projects, but I realize at some point
that I don't need to finish them all the time and I still learn a lot from
them. Most of them are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/onelikeandidie). I
program on my time off and on my commute (when I used to have one).

I also help a local community of developers called
[Meetballs](https://meetballs.org) with their website and have hosted a few
sessions on their meetups.

## Contact

I am interested in collaborating on game jams! I have participated in a few
and only finished a couple of them. I am always looking for new people to
collaborate with. If you are interested, please reach out to me on
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@onelikeandidie) or on
[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@onelikeandidie:matrix.org).
